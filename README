FIXME: polish this documentation file before the official release!

TopGen provides a simulation of the Internet (Web, DNS, etc.) for
cybersecurity exercise environments.


1. Scraper

Web content is served from a single instance of nginx, using virtual
hostsing (vhosts). The scraper (topgen-scrape.sh) will statically
download a set of sites listed in /etc/topgen/scrape_sites.txt, and,
if needed, generate certificates for each virtual web host (vhost)
signed with a topgen-specific self-signed CA (which is also generated
if needed).

Alternatively, a pre-existing set of vhosts (and certificates) can be
imported into /var/lib/topgen/<...>. Note that, depending on the size
of the desired set of sites to download, the scraper may run for a long
time (e.g., several weeks for collecting the top-500 most popular sites
at depth 1).

2. DNS

Given a set of scraped Web vhosts, a DNS configuration can be generated
(using topgen-mkdns.sh). Thirteen root DNS servers (a..m), three top-level
domain servers, and two public caching servers are simulated with a single
instance of named, using views. The DNS configuration generator can accept
a list of delegations (/etc/topgen/delegations.dns) for forward 2nd-level
domains and reverse /24 networks, in case the exercise being supported
contains authoritative DNS service for its own domain(s) and network(s).

3. Systemd (service startup)

After scraping the list of desired Web vhosts (or installing the Web
content manually under /var/lib/topgen/<...>), start the topgen-nginx
service ("systemctl start topgen-nginx"), and optionally the topgen-dns
service ("systemctl start topgen-dns"). All Web vhost (and virtual DNS
server) IP addresses will be configured as secondaries on the loopback
interface (and DNS configuration will be created on demand). At this
stage, TopGen Web and DNS functionality can be tested locally.

4. Routing (quagga/bgpd)

To act as a universal Web (and DNS) server to the rest of the machines
in an exercise, the host running TopGen must announce a default BGP
route. The include example kickstart file (contrib/greybox_f22.ks) will
automatically create a BGP configuration assuming the default gateway
used during the install to be the BGP peer. Edit /etc/quagga/bgpd.conf
to modify parameters as needed (BGP peer IP address, AS number, etc.).
Once BGP is configured, starting the bgpd service ("systemctl start bgpd")
will begin announcing a default route into BGP, attracting all Web and
DNS traffic which isn't served by a more specific route elsewhere in the
exercise.

5. CORE containers

In addition to acting as a standalone Web and DNS simulator, TopGen
can run inside a CORE (http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/products/core)
container. In addition to Web and DNS, using CORE allows us to simulate
an "Internet Backbone" consisting of several containerized BGP routers.
A pair of example topologies are included in contrib/core/topo/. One
example, topgen.imn, allows for self-contained testing where the "user"
machine is also simulated as a container on the same host which supports
the TopGen and BGP backbone containers. The other example, greybox.imn,
allows a second network interface (eth1) on the host machine to link the
simulated Internet consisting of a TopGen and several BGP containers to
the rest of the exercise, which is presumably hosted on other machines.

To start a CORE topology, first ensure the core daemon is running by
launching its service ("systemctl start core-daemon"). Next, log in
via the GUI and, from a terminal, launch "core-gui", then load one of
the desired topoloy *.imn files, and click on the green "play" button.
For detailed instructions on how to operate the CORE environment, please
consult the manual available at http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/products/core.
