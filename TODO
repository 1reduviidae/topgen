- add debian/ubuntu package spec

- split out topgen-scrape.sh (or implement sub-commands); these are
  all potentially very long running operations (e.g., scraping may
  take weeks), so unexpected things may happen, and resuming manually
  should be possible without too much overhead:
	- scraping
	- certificate generation
	- vhost IP address resolution

- consider a dedicated topgen-quagga service for announcing a default route
	- right now, kickstart configures bgpd.conf based on assumptions
	  including the current default gateway during install

- can we configure topgen-loopback service to shut down when last service
  depending on it goes away ?

- SELinux policy for topgen-mkdns.sh (right now it calls chcon explicitly)

- add simulated EMAIL (Webmail) services: "Gmail", "Yahoo", etc.

- augment Web and DNS data with (simulated) WHOIS functionality

- integrate with user simulation (GUS ?)

- add simulated TOR containers (when used with core)
