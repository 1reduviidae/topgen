create new VM (consider 256G hdd for full topgen corpus)

set new VM to boot from CD (Fedora-Server-netinst-x86_64-22.iso)

move cursor to "Install Fedora 22", hit <Tab>, and backspace until only
	"vmlinuz initrd=initrd.img" are left; Then add the following:
	" ks=http://mirror.ini.cmu.edu/ks/greybox22.ks", so that the
	boot command line looks like this:

"> vmlinuz initrd=initrd.img ks=http://mirror.ini.cmu.edu/ks/greybox22.ks"

	... then hit <Enter>, and wait until the whole install proces
	completes (you'll get a message saying "hit any key to reboot").

boot the newly installed machine from hdd (by disconnecting the CD image)

log in as Admin, password tartans@1

open a terminal, and become root: "su -", password is also tartans@1

run "topgen-scrape.sh", which will tell you it needs at least one site
	listed under /etc/topgen/scrape_sites.txt

edit /etc/topgen/scrape_sites.txt, and uncomment "www.wikipedia.org"

re-run "topgen-scrape.sh" and wait for a few (approx. 15) minutes while
	it scrapes wikipedia, issues a root CA, signs all vhosts, collects
	their IP addresses, etc.

	The collected (vhosts) and generated (certs, etc) content will
	be located under /var/lib/topgen/<...> (which is where you should
	unpack the 133Gig worth of data available on babette)

run "systemctl start topgen-nginx topgen-named" which will start nginx,
	as well as named (and generate the named configuration data from
	the available nginx vhosts if needed), configure IPs on the loopback,
	etc.

	At this point you should be able to see www.wikipedia.org,
	topgen.info, and the DNS servers (8.8.8.8 in particular) being
	local (on the loopback interface). So all DNS is resolved by
	the local topgen-named, and the two web sites mentioned above
	will be served by the local topgen-nginx.

open firefox, and navigate to "topgen.info" where you'll notice a few
	links (to access topgen.info via https, to download the topgen
	CA cert, and to access the list of scraped sites, which at this
	point probably only include wikipedia.org).

download and install the CA certificate, then switch to the https version
	of topgen.info, visit wikipedia.org by following the link, etc.

shut down topgen by running "systemctl stop topgen*", which will include
	shutting down the loopback configuration (i.e. will remove all
	secondary loopback IPs from the "lo" interface).

	At this point your test VM should be "back to normal" in terms of
	networking.

start core-daemon ("systemctl start core-daemon"), then fire up core-gui
	from a regular (non-root) Administrator shell window.

load and launch /usr/share/doc/topgen/contrib/core_topo/topgen.imn
	rather than navigating the open-file dialog in core-gui, you can
	start it by mentioning the imn file directly on the command line:

"core-gui /usr/share/doc/topgen/contrib/core_topo/topgen.imn"

open a shell window on the User container, and traceroute to topgen,
	resolve www.wikipedia.org in DNS, load it in lynx, etc to test
	greybox containers locally. (the file
	/usr/share/doc/topgen/contrib/core_topo/topgen.imn contains the
	same topology but with an "eth1" connection to an external
	exercise setup, but will need to be edited to reflect your
	second physical ethernet connection, which may be "ens33" instead
	of "eth1", depending on your emulated hardware, before it could
	be successfully started).

Enjoy,
